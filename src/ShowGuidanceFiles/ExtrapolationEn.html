Several statistical extrapolation options are available and will be described below. Extrapolations from consumption data are made on a planning unit-by-planning unit basis. </p>
										<p style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-color: #272127;font-weight: bold;">Using this screen:</span></p>
		<p>
			<b>1.Getting started on extrapolation:</b>
			<ul style="font-size: 13px;">
				<li>Before you use this screen, please ensure you have completed the '<a href="/#/dataentry/consumptionDataEntryAndAdjustment" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Entry and Adjustment</a>' screen for each planning unit and region you would like to extrapolate</li>
				<li>Use the filters at the top of this screen to select the planning unit, region to extrapolate, and date range for historical data to utilize. </li>
				<li>The user may select one -or several of the extrapolation methods available in QAT, as appropriate to the general consumption pattern and available data, as will be discussed below. See sections 2-4 below for an explanation of the extrapolation methods and how to best choose methods for your forecast. </li>
				<li> Note that changes in this screen are optional - QAT automatically applies the default extrapolation parameters to all planning units after the Adjustments screen has been completed. The user then makes the final forecast selection in the '<a href="/#/report/compareAndSelectScenario" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Compare and Select Forecast</a>'  screen.</li></ul><b>2.Extrapolation methods available in QAT</b><p class="pl-lg-3">Forecast methods in QAT are organized from simple to sophisticated.</p>
				<ol type="a" style="font-size: 13px;">
					<li><b>Moving Average:</b> Moving average is an average that moves along time, dropping older data as it incorporates newer data. For QAT to calculate the moving average, enter the number months in the past that you would like to use in the calculation of the average.  
						The user may select any positive integer for this field. Entering 5 for example would mean 
						that the projection for the next month in the series would be the average of the preceding 
						five months average. This method is most useful for short-term forecasts and is sensitive 
						to trends. It is not appropriate for seasonal data
					</li>
					<li><b>Semi-Averages:</b>Semi-average estimates trends based on two halves of a series. QAT 
						divides the actual data into two equal parts (halves) and the arithmetic mean of the values 
						of each part (half) is calculated as the y values of two points on a line. The slope 
						of the trend line is determined by the difference between these y values over time as 
						defined by the difference of the midpoints of the two halves of the series, or x values, 
						of the points. This method is sensitive to trends and useful for short- and medium-term 
						forecasts but is not appropriate for seasonal data. 
					</li>
					<li><b>Linear Regression:</b> Linear regression models the relationship between two variables 
						by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Confidence interval :  between 0% and 100% 
						(exclusive) e.g. 90% confidence level indicates 90% of possible future points are to fall 
						within this radius from prediction represented by the regression line. This method is not 
						appropriate for seasonal data.
					</li>
					<li><b>Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters):</b>  In statistics, different types of 
						smoothing are used to filter out the noise so that we can see patterns in a time series 
						dataset more clearly. Exponential smoothing uses older data at exponentially decreasing 
						weights over time. Smoothing parameters in exponential smoothing are set between 0 and 1, 
						with values close to 1 favoring recent values and values close to 0 favoring older values. 
						Users utilizing triple exponential smoothing can choose from four parameters:
						<ul>
							<li>alpha, applies to the level or baseline of the dataset. Higher alpha values give more weight to the more recent data</li>
							<li>beta, determines how strongly recent trends should be valued as compared to older trends</li>
							<li>gamma, reflects the seasonal component of the forecast. Seasonal generally refers to repeating patterns within a year. The higher the gamma, the more weight will be applied to the most recent seasonal component of the data.</li>
							<li>Seasonality: In QAT, a season can be described as the expected length (in months) of any repetitive pattern in the consumption</li>
							<li>Confidence interval:  between 0% and 100% (exclusive) e.g. 90% confidence level indicates 
								90% of future points are to fall within this radius from prediction.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li><b>ARIMA:</b> ARIMA modeling enables two statistical models designed for stationary time 
							series to be integrated and applied to non-stationary time series, that is, time series 
							that have trends or seasons. It is often applied to short term forecasts. Auto-regressive 
							means each point in the regression is influenced by its previous values and moving 
							average implies that each point is an average, a linear combination of one or more 
							adjacent points. Both the auto-regression and the moving average are integrated together 
							to fit a best model for the series through differencing, or literally using the 
							difference between points on a time series for the analysis instead of the raw values. 
							ARIMA models have three parameters:
							<ul>
								<li>p or AR (lag order): the number of lag observations in the model</li>
								<li>d or I (degree of differencing): the number of times that the raw observations 
									are differenced. This value is normally 1 (if there is a trend) or 0 (no trend). 
									Other higher values are possible but not expected.
								</li>
								<li>q or MA (order of the moving average): the size of the moving average window or 
									the number of differenced observations to be averaged.
								</li>
								<li>QATâ€™s default values for ARIMA parameters are p = 0, d = 1, q = 1. 
								</li>
								<li>Confidence interval:  between 0% and 100% (exclusive) e.g. 90% confidence level 
									indicates 90% of future points are to fall within this radius from prediction. 
								</li>
								<br>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<b style="font-size: 13px;">3.Which extrapolation method should I use?</b>
				<p class="pl-lg-3" style="font-size: 13px;">Below are some considerations for selecting a forecast method. Forecast 
					methods in QAT are organized from simple to sophisticated. In general,
					<ul style="font-size: 13px;">
						<li>More sophisticated models are more sensitive to problems in the data </li>
						<li>If you have poorer data (missing data points, variable reporting rates,
							 <i class="fa fa-angle-left" aria-hidden="true">12</i> months of data), simpler 
							 forecast methods are recommended
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="pl-lg-3" style="font-size: 13px;">The choice of extrapolation method depends on the expected pattern in 
						the data. Some typical patterns include:
						<ul style="font-size: 13px;">
							<li>Stationary, where the range of observed values over time hover around an 
								average. Models applied to such datasets may include
								<ul>
									<li>Moving Average</li>
									<li>ARIMA</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Trending with no seasonal component, where the observed values have an 
								increasing or decreasing trend. Models applied to such datasets may include
								<ul>
									<li>Semi-averages</li>
									<li>Linear Regression</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Trending and Seasonal, where the observed values in a dataset have both 
								trend and seasonal components. Models applied to such datasets may include
								<ul>
									<li>ARIMA Model</li>
									<li>Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)</li>
								</ul> 
							</li>
							<li>
								Seasonal without trend, where the observed values have a seasonal component 
								but no trend. Models applied to such datasets may include 
								<ul>
									<li>Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)  </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							</ul>
						
							<p>The models suggested 
										here are neither exhaustive nor exclusive. QAT enables the user to 
										apply a variety of extrapolation methods and then to compare them 
										using best fit or forecast error metrics. 
							</p>
							
							<p>The second step is to consider whether the forecast values are expected to 
								reflect closely the historical patterns in your data and so whether you will 
								use the error metrics to inform your selection. However, when choosing to 
								disregard the error metric, it will be important to document your rationale 
								for doing so to inform discussions or reviews of your forecast and to help 
								future forecasters to support their decisions.
							 </p>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<b style="font-size: 13px;">4.How do I interpret errors?</b>
						<p class="pl-lg-3" style="font-size: 13px;">QAT automatically calculates forecast error metrics using several 
							methods. These include:
							<ul style="font-size: 13px;">
								<li>MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): can be interpreted as the average percentage
									difference between predictions and their intended targets in the dataset. For example, if
									MAPE is 15% then your predictions are on average 15% away from the actual values.</li>
									<br><img class="img-fluid" src="../ShowGuidanceFiles/img/MAPE.png"><br>

									<li style="margin-top: 20px;">WAPE (Weighted Absolute Percentage Error): WAPE is an appropriate metric for when the
										dataset used has low or intermittent values. A WAPE percentage of 5 means that the
										forecast was off by 5% over the entire dataset for a certain evaluation period. Depending on
										the use case, it is recommended to choose a model that gives the least WAPE value.</li>
										<br><img class="img-fluid" src="../ShowGuidanceFiles/img/WAPE.png"><br>

										<li style="margin-top: 20px;">RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): RMSE can be interpreted as the average error that the
											model's predictions have in comparison with the actual, with extra weight added to larger
											prediction errors. Generally, the closer RMSE is to zero, the more accurate the model.</li>
											<br><img class="img-fluid" src="../ShowGuidanceFiles/img/RMSE.png"><br>

											<li style="margin-top: 20px;">MSE (Mean Squared Error): MSE is the aggregated mean of the squared difference between
												the actuals and predictions. Large errors are highlighted due to this squaring. MSE is useful
												when working on models where occasional large errors must be minimized. Generally, the
												closer it is to 0, the more accurate the model.</li>
												<br><img class="img-fluid" src="../ShowGuidanceFiles/img/MSE.png"><br>
											<li style="margin-top: 20px;">R 2 (the squared correlation between the dependent variable and the fitted values):
													R 2 = 1 - [sum squared regression (SSR) / total sum of squares (SST)], where the sum
													squared of the residuals for the regression (SSR) is the sum of its residuals squared, and the
													total sum of squares (SST) is the sum of the distance the data is away from the mean, all
													squared. The R 2 value is always a number between 0 and 1. R 2 is a measure the fit of a
													regression line to a series of historical observations with values closer to 1 indicating a
													stronger correspondence between the actual and predicted (regression model) values. It is
													not a measure of error and should not be used by itself to assess the fitness of a prediction,
													but in combination with other error metrics and the user's knowledge of the program.</li>
													<br><img class="img-fluid" src="../ShowGuidanceFiles/img/r2.png">
													<br>
								<!-- <li>MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)</li>
								<li>WAPE (Weighted Absolute Percentage Error)</li>
								<li>RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)</li>
								<li>MSE (Mean Squared Error)<br>In general, the lower the error score, 
									the more closely the forecast method result fits the historical data. 
									In models where historical patterns in a data set are expected to be 
									reflected in the future values, a low error value could be used to help 
									select a preferred extrapolation method, and QAT will highlight these 
									best fits in a table. However, if substantial changes are anticipated, 
									the best fit extrapolation may not be the forecast the user selects.
								</li> -->
								<br>
								<p>Apart from R 2 the lower the score, the more closely the forecast method result fits the historical
									data. In models where historical patterns in a data set are expected to be reflected in the future
									values, a low error value could be used to help select a preferred extrapolation method, and QAT
									will highlight these best fits in a table. However, if substantial changes which do not fit the historical
									data are anticipated, the best fit extrapolation may not be the most appropriate forecast to select.</p>
								<p>To make the best selection between extrapolation methods for your purpose, 
									the most important thing is first understanding which method of 
									extrapolation is most appropriate for the expected pattern in the data. <br>
									Forecast methods in QAT are organized from simple to sophisticated. In 
									general,
									<ul style="font-size: 13px;">
										<li>More sophisticated models are more sensitive to problems in the 
											data 
										</li>
										<li>If you have poorer data (missing data points, variable reporting 
											rates, <i class="fa fa-angle-left" aria-hidden="true">12</i> 
											months of data), simpler forecast methods are recommended<br>The 
											second step is to consider whether the forecast values are 
											expected to reflect closely the historical patterns in your 
											data and so whether you will use the error metrics to inform your 
											selection. However, when choosing to disregard the error metric, 
											it will be important to document your rationale for doing so to 
											inform discussions or reviews of your forecast and to help 
											future forecasters to support their decisions.
