## QAT

QAT is built in two modules - the supply planning module (launched December 2020) and the forecasting module (launched June 2022). 

Up to the point of going Opensource we have released all of the code on the `master2` branch only. But from now on we will be releasing Production code on branches tagged as `master.major_no.minor_no`

To get the latest Release version you can always pull from the `master2` branch
In progress development code can be pulled from the `devMod2` branch


Information on how to build and host plus additional technical information is provided in our [Technical documentation](https://github.com/HSS-FASP-Team/fasp-api/blob/master2/docs/QAT-technical-manual.md) located in the docs folder.

The Quantification Analytics Tool (QAT) is a modernized solution for country-led forecasting and supply planning. QAT leverages new technologies to enhance and modernize the functionality offered by the incumbent PipeLine (supply planning) and Quantimed (forecasting) tools by providing advanced visualizations, master data management, and updated planning logic on a cloud-based solution with offline functionality.
